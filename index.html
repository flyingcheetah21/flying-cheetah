    <h1>Protecting Forests and Farms Through Intelligent Aerial Insight</h1>
    <p>Sylva Systems is a student-led environmental technology startup using advanced drone imaging and systems analytics to detect vegetation stress and ecological risk before damage spreads.</p>

    <h2>Monitoring Land at Scale Is Increasingly Difficult</h2>
    <p>Large agricultural operations and conservation areas face a growing challenge: identifying plant stress, disease, and environmental disruption early enough to act.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Traditional inspections are labor-intensive, reactive, and often too late to prevent meaningful loss. By the time symptoms are visible from the ground, impact has already occurred.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Early Detection. Actionable Intelligence.</h2>
    <p>Sylva Systems deploys unmanned aerial systems equipped with high-resolution imaging to monitor vegetation health across large areas efficiently.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Through systematic analysis of aerial data, we identify subtle patterns of stress and irregular growth before they become visible to the naked eye.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Our mission is to provide land managers with clear, data-driven insight that protects yield, biodiversity, and long-term ecosystem stability.</p>
